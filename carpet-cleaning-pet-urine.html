Physics class, or wait was that biology, tough us, in order to&nbsp;neutralize a high PH&nbsp;you have to&nbsp;use a substance&nbsp;which contains&nbsp;a low PH&nbsp;to aid in&nbsp;getting it as close to neutral&nbsp;on the PH scale as possible. A good example of a neutral liquid is, tap water.</p><p>What we recommend is using distilled&nbsp;over the counter cleaning acetic acid aka:&nbsp;&ldquo;vinegar&rdquo; &ndash; make sure and get the clear stuff, not the apple cider variation. Simply get&nbsp;the affected area damp with a around five to six quirts from a trigger sprayer. Basically you want to put down the same amount that your little furry friend put down.

Removing the urine stain out of the carpet can also usually be removed as long as you have us out to your home as soon as possible. The reason the stain itself might become permanent is because the bacteria and ammonia combination can actually strip the carpet of its coloring and create a &ldquo;bleaching&rdquo; effect on the area while also &ldquo;staining&rdquo; the area yellow.

Some situations you will be better off replacing either the carpet, pad, or sub floor. Most situations we are able to work miracles, though sometimes it just makes more sense to just replace some parts of the pad or carpet instead of spending time and money with restoring the effected carpeted areas that have been damaged.
